[ DOG BARKS ] [ THEY WHISPER ] I heard a dog. Did you? Must be outside. [ DOG BARKS ] Dad! We were going to hide him till tomorrow but... he didn't want to go along with the plan, did you? Happy Christmas, sweetheart. What are you going to call him, love? I don't know yet. Hey there, boy. Do you want to take him out? Come on, then. Let's go. Get some clothes on. Hey, boy. What, sick? 'Apparently he's on his deathbed.' Yeah. What, again? Yeah. No, of course. Yeah, in ten. In ten. Right, cheers. Sorry, Goose. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Linda, I have to go into work, love. Honey, have you seen my keys? No, sorry. I can't find them anywhere. Er... Goose, have you seen my keys, mate? No, Dad. Oh, Lind, you're going to have to drive me in, love. Really? He'll be fine. Yep. [ MUSIC: "Wonderful Christmas time" by Tom McRae ] Ah! [ INCREASES VOLUME ] Hey! No, it's too sad! Ah, ah! Take Langford, it's quicker. Know-it-all! [ GLASS SMASHES ] [ CHURCH BELLS CHIME ] [ MUSIC: "I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday" by Wizzard ] You all right, mate? Hey. Anthony? You OK? [ HE SIGHS ] It's snowing. Not in Manchester, mate. It just rains. A monkey. Snowing. With an angel's head. Snowing monkeys? Yeah, I'll watch out for them! Hey! Mutt. Come on, Mutt. [ MUSIC: "Stop The Cavalry" by Jona Lewie ] What you doing, Nan? Well, it's not going to cook itself, is it, darling? That's the washing machine, Nan. Oven's there. And it's only Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve? Yeah. Nan! I'll help you... ...tomorrow. I will. Oh, and put it back in the fridge. [ KNOCKS ON DOOR ] All right! Please stop. Please. [ KNOCKS CONTINUE ] Who is it? It's me. Come on, Frank, it's freezing. I'm coming. Silly little... Nice pants. Thanks. What have I told you before? No dogs. Oh, come on. He'll freeze to death here. Look, I've got the hangover from hell, all right? Besides, I've just tidied up. OK, Mutt. Won't be long. Tidied up? Still no luck, then? No, I've looked everywhere. I tell you what, Goose. If I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all. Come on, then. Let's see what you've got. It's mint. It's plate. You can pick these up anywhere. Yeah? [ MAN COUGHS ] You all right, pal? Don't think so. Oh, yeah. Why is that, then? I don't know. I think maybe... Maybe I'm not... here. Hear that, Millsy? Fella ain't here. Millsy. Windmills. Windmills go backwards, forwards, in Ireland. Bit early for that, is it not? Yeah, been drinking... paraffin. Used to make chewing gum. Not from Manchester, are ya? No. Don't think so. He don't know where he's from. Check your wallet. Got... Ooh, matches. Matches? A sock. More matches. Must be a heavy smoker. Poker chip. Pez. Pez. And... that's it. Is that gold? How did you do that, you madhead? Don't pull, you numpty. You'll break the strap. [ SIREN WAILS ] Come on. This stuff's all right but, I mean, this is rubbish. You what? How many times have I got to tell you? No-one wants a straight mobile any more. Not unless it's a free gift with one of these. And this... You serious? I'll give you 50 quid, as it's Christmas. For the lot? It's a fair price. It's not. It's not, Frank. What are you doing? I'm going to go see what Kermit'll give us. Now, you listen to me, you stay away from Kermit. You understand? He's a nutter. You can't tell me what to do, Frank. You're NOT my dad. All right. I'll give you 70 quid. 100. 80. I want a 100. You haven't really got the hang of this haggling thing, have ya? All right. I'll give you 100. But you have got to promise me to stay away from Kermit, all right? Promise? Go on, then. Get out of here. [ FRANK CHUCKLES ] It's all there, Goose. You're the one who always said count it. Yeah, but I didn't mean with me, though, did I? What are you doing tomorrow? Why? Come on over, if you want. Can't guarantee the turkey will be cooked but it'll be clean. I don't know. I've got things to do. Thanks, though. Mutt? Mutt? Mutt? Mutt? Have you seen my dog, mate? He's white, with a black patch. No, I'm sorry. Mutt? Mutt? Have you lost something? My bangle. I must've dropped it when I was out earlier. And I was wondering if that's it. Can you see it? The lady's lost her bangle. A snake, gold. A gold cobra. Quiver. Sorry? A quiver of cobras. A murder of crows. [ CROWS CAW ] A pomp of Pekingese. A quiver of cobras? Is that what they're really called? I think so. You sounded like you knew. All these things on the tip of my brain. Bangle. What are you saying? Ah. Scissors. Invented by Leonardo da Vinci. Well, thank you for trying. The wedding. He gave it to you at a wedding. How can you... There's a garden. It's your garden. A boy comes in... Comes in through the window. And he takes it. He takes the bangle. How could you possibly know? I don't know. [ DOG BARKS ] Mutt? Mutt? Mutt? What are you doing? That's an odd question. You're going to work? Yep. Today? There's someone I have to see before the holidays. Henry. It'll only be an hour or two. Fine. I'll go on my own, then. Don't be like that. I have responsibilities. What about your responsibility to me? To Milly? Look, if I'm running late, I'll text, meet you there. OK? Bye. [ HE SIGHS ] Mutt? [ DOG BARKS ] Mutt? Oh, have you seen my dog, Stu? No, Goose. Sorry, mate. [ DOG BARKS ] All right, young man? I'm Anthony. An-tho-ny. An-tho-ny. I am An-thon-y. Anthony. I'm Anthony. Mutt? Argh! Aglet. You what? The hard bit on the end of your lace is called an aglet. And this bit is called the glabella. Joins your eyebrows up. Someone, somewhere, came up with a word for everything. Owls got three eyelids. Each one's got a name. It's not just names. I know that Mel Blanc's tombstone says, "That's all, folks." Coke'd be green if they didn't color it brown. And hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia is the fear of long words. Lost something? Maybe. My dog. Mutt? Yeah, you seen him? No, you were shouting "Mutt". Brilliant. I had a dog when I was your age. Yeah? Or maybe I never had a dog. There's a lot I'm not quite too sure about these days. Like this. Look. You see, I don't really feel like an Anthony. You don't know what you're called? No. Other stuff seems to have got in the way. The aglet stuff? Yeah. And then I saw you. Oh, yeah! And it seemed like a pattern. Because you stole the bangle. She lost the bangle. You stole the bangle. You lost a dog. It's a pattern. It's a pattern! [ MUSIC: "I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday" by Wizzard ] What do you want? Mrs Thornhill, I'm Henry Penvell, Richard's probation officer. There's no Richard here. No. It... Can I help you, dear? It's your grandson, Richard. He missed his appointment with me this morning. Richard? My grandson? Oh, you mean Goose. No-one calls him Richard. No, he's not here. This is serious, Mrs Thornhill. The terms of Richard's... The terms of Goose's supervision order clearly state he must not miss any of his appointments. It really is very serious, Mrs Thornhill. And then he goes, "She lost her bangle." "And you stole it." What do you reckon? Copper? Nah. Manchester's finest have got better things to do than hang out with kids on Christmas Eve. They'd get themselves arrested. So this bloke, did he have a name? Yeah. Anthony. Though he said it wasn't. So, then, how do you know it was? Cos he had a name badge on. It said, "I'm Anthony". Oh, ho-ho, no! What? I know him. I bumped into that joker last night. You know, he did have a dog collar. You're winding me up. No, no! He had a dog collar round his wrist. He did. You serious? Yeah. You think he took Mutt? I dunno. But I remember someone saying that... There was this geezer who used to nick dogs and then, when the owners put up reward posters, he'd give 'em back, claim the money. Come on, then. We better go see. What's with all this "we" business? He might be a total nut job, Frank. All the more reason for leaving well alone. Dad would've come. Ooh, you are a manipulative little git, you know that? I was just making Goose a sandwich for his lunch. Would you like one? No, thank you. Mrs Thornhill, do you know when Goose is going to be... Erm... Tea? You've already asked. No, thanks. Do you have any idea where Goose might be? Went out with Mutt this morning. Right, so you said. He may have had an appointment, with his probation officer. That's... that's me. Remember? He's usually back for his lunch. I'm just doing him a sandwich. Would you like to stay? Thanks. I can't, I'm afraid. Not today. Not a good day. It's not, is it? You're not very well, are you, Mrs Thornhill? No. I don't think I am. Do you remember if anybody has been to see you since the accident? Erm, anyone like me? Anyone like you? Hm. No. I think I'd remember someone like you. Don't worry. It must be hard for you. Looking after someone like Goose. He is a bit of a handful. But, in time, all things grow towards the sun. My mother always used to say that. Yeah. Frank. You leave this to me, all right? Oi! [ FRANK WHISTLES ] How's it going with the monkey angels, mate? Yes. Angel with a monkey's head. Yes. Don't know. Ri-ight. Told ya. You do something with his dog? I don't think so. So what's that on your wrist? You nick dogs, then, do you? Why would I do that? For the reward. There's a reward? No. Then why would I take your dog? And how do you know about this bangle? I saw him take it. No, you never. Yes, I did. How do you mean? An Indian woman, I touched her hand... You have a torch. Bangle's on the chair. You take the bangle. Wait. Rewind. What do you mean, you saw it? I just did. Oh, come on, Frank! Come here, Goose. Oi! All right. Show us, then. Give him your hand. See if he knows what you lost. Lost. Everybody's lost something. [ TV: ] This is a marvelous story. I remember reading this as a boy. It was bought during the war for six pence. Six pence was a lot of money then. Well, yes. Now, the thing is, Raven Publishing, they weren't around for very long and the artist they commissioned to illustrate their Wilde series... I mean, the illustrations are marvelous, aren't they? The artist was Walter Crane but sadly Raven went bankrupt almost immediately afterwards. Really? Yes. So, how much is it worth? Well, I think you'll be fairly surprised to discover just what a first edition of The Happy Prince by Oscar Wilde will go for at an auction today. I haven't really given it much thought. Well, in this condition, I'd estimate it at roundabout... Well, somewhere in the region of... £40,000. [ SHE GASPS ] How much? 40,000. Thank you for bringing it in. £40,000! £40,000! Oh, my... Oh, God! The Happy Prince, Oscar Wilde, 1888, £40,000. Where is it, mate? I've looked everywhere. It's just a wind-up, Frank. Everyone knows you lost that book. Please. Please. "High above the city, on a tall column, "stood the statue of The Happy Prince. "He was gilded all over with thin leaves and fine gold. "For eyes, he had two bright sapphires and a large... "He was very much admired, indeed. "'He's as beautiful as a weathercock', remarked one of the town councillors." He's as beautiful as a weathercock. Yes. [ BANGING ] Australia? Bloody Australia? What do you expect? You're taking my daughter to the other side of the world forever. Please, Frank. I can't do this anymore. Not anymore. Not since... What are you saying, it's all my fault? You're just like all the others. "High above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of The Happy Prince. "It is not to Egypt that I'm going, said the swallow. "I'm going to the house of death. "Death is the brother of sleep, is it not? ''Bring me the two most precious things in the city, "said God to one of his angels. "The angel brought him..." Good night, Dr Clarence. "High above the city, on a tall column, "stood the statue of The Happy Prince." Dr Clarence? Well, he can't get many patients. He got himself struck off. How'd you mean? When he retired, he said if someone had a heart attack in the street and he went to help, he could get sued if he was still a doctor. Got himself struck off and no-one could touch him. They don't come much stubborner than Dr Clarence. Hi. What have you got to be so happy about? Er, I was just wondering, you didn't happen to accidentally pick up a book of mine, did you, from the pub a while ago? The Happy Prince? Oscar Wilde? I would have thought Nuts was more your sort of thing, Frank. Sentimental value, you know. And it's worth £40,000. Yeah. Thanks. I suppose you'd better come in. Come on. Don't worry. I'm sure Professor X will find it. Please. He's joking, ain't he? Put them there. Mate! So, Oscar Wilde? Yes. I remember I thought it looked a little unusual at the time. They were Walter Crane illustrations, weren't they? Yeah. Oh, that would be valuable. You got it? What makes you think I have? What? He touched Frank's hand. Said you picked it up in a pub. Oh, were you there? No, he saw it in his head. Oh. Yeah, I know. You haven't heard of anything like it before, have you? Well... It doesn't... feel right. Plus, he's completely forgotten who he is and everything. Except for the stuff about owls and aglets. Aglets? [ BOTH: ] Aglets. The hard bit on the end of your lace. Very interesting. It's really not that interesting. Oi! What? I'd really like to know what's happening to me. Sorry, I'm not a doctor. Not anymore. Oh. But, well... Well, occasionally dreams and reality can get a bit muddled. You think I'm crazy? I don't feel crazy. Inside. I'm not saying you are. It can happen to patients who've been in a coma, as well. It's called Hypnos. From the Greek. Hypnos was Morpheus's father, son of... Nyx. Night. So I've been in a coma? It's... possible. As I say... Yeah, and as I say, none of this Greek mythology is getting me Mutt back. Mutt. Mutt's his dog. I thought I had something to do with lost things. Bangles. Books. Dogs. You see, everyone I've met has lost something. Except for you. "My dearest Rafe, it breaks my heart... "I just can't do this any more... "somewhere along the way we started to drift apart... "If I tried, we'd both know... "It hurts too much... the distance between us... "Please believe that I wish..." "You'll always have my heart, Rafe." It's still there. It's under the floorboards. My book's under the floorboards? I'm not sure I... Leave it. If that's what you think is best. Here. From my wife. She said she left... All this time... And I thought she'd gone without a word. I was so angry. So stubborn. Too stubborn to look for her. Too stubborn... to tell her how much I loved her. To tell her she was... ...everything to me. Frank. There is a kind of system. It's in the hall. By the phone. Thanks. Who are you? I wish I knew. So I give back the bangle? Then what? You find me Mutt. You think so? 40 grand! 40 beautiful grand. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy a BMW. 7 series? How much are they? 25 if you're lucky. Sweet! Five grand'll get me out of debt and get me some new togs and that'll still leave me... Ten grand. Ten grand for a rainy day. I'd buy a big umbrella! Yeah, a really big umbrella. Perfect. What's that supposed to mean? It means you know your mind. So I'm going to drive round to her place, dressed to the nines. A... No. No. I don't want to know what dressed to the nines means where it comes from. I'll take for a posh curry, tell her I'm out of trouble, out of debt and finished with all the dodgy stuff. And if she doesn't like that... She can shove it. She can shove it! A man with a plan. Sorry, mate. What is your problem? Hmm? Don't look at me with your spooky eyes. You're not exactly a man with a plan yourself, are you? Don't know who you are. Falling asleep in the street and touching people's hands and going all mystic on them. You're weird, you know that? So just shut it, all right? I didn't say anything. No. Well, she's my wife, not yours. You didn't marry her, did you? Don't know. Can't remember. Trust me. You didn't. I would've noticed. So what are you going to do? I'm going to show her the book, prove I'm not a loser. She doesn't think you're a loser. What do you know? She thinks you're a good father. I saw. Watch this. What's going to happen? He's going to ring the doorbell. Frank. What a nice surprise! Do you know what this is? This is a first edition of The Happy Prince by Oscar Wilde, illustrated by Walter Crane. And it's worth £40,000. And you know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to give it to you. What? It's for Australia. So you can start a new life for yourselves. Whatever you want. Frank, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I feel fine, actually. 40,000? Are you sure this isn't one of... It's rare. It's really rare. You used to read it to me. Yeah. All that time we were scratching around for money, it was right under our nose. And you're just giving it to us to go to Australia? Happy Christmas! I'm going to miss you. Both of you. Dad! Come on. Come inside. Come inside. Let's talk about this. Just... just give me a minute. There's 150 quid. It's all I got. The bangle - I sold it, to Noel. Now don't let him rip you off, OK? He only gave me 40 quid for it. 40 quid? But you gave me 100. Yeah, well, someone's got to look out for you, haven't they? Thanks. Prepare for slime on a stick. Here's hoping we've got enough. Otherwise we going to have to dazzle him with some fact about ducks and trousers. I don't know any facts about ducks and trousers. Oh. Hang on. Donald Duck's dad is called Quackmore Duck. Nothing about trousers. Knew it! Ding-dong! I'll be right with you. What do you want? I want to buy that bangle back. The one Frank sold you. I don't know anyone called Frank. No? No. And I think you ought to leave. I did say "buy". I don't know what you're talking about. Maybe I'll just give the cops a bell, then. Tell them where you got that carriage clock from. [ NOEL LAUGHS ] How dare you? I have receipts for everything. Not that, you don't, cos I snagged it out of a house on Ashford Road. Right, get out. Go on, get out now. Or that pocket watch? Or that tankard? [ MUSIC BOX PLAYS ] [ PHONE RINGS ] "Emergency. Which service, please?" Police. Yeah, all right! All right. I sold it. You're lying. No. Oh, whatever. Of course, I might be able to remember who I sold it to... ...if the price was right. How much? Probably all of it. All of it? I think so. Here. Good lad. Come on, then. Tell us. Well, now, I sold it to a woman with some orange flowers. That's it? Well! For 150 quid, that's all I get? You wanted to know. [ GOOSE SIGHS ] It's OK. I know who she is. How do you know who she is? Thank you very much. Come on. How did you do that? Don't know. Must have learnt it somewhere. Like the fascinating facts? I suppose so. Come on. Anyway, you say you know who this woman is. Yeah, I just saw her. You saw her? Yeah, just saw her. She was getting on the bus. She had the flowers. You what? Number 47. It's Christmas. She could be going anywhere. You don't go just anywhere with a bunch of flowers. At Christmas, you do. Not with flowers. We'll see. Yeah. And maybe we won't This bus goes everywhere. Well, haven't you ever wanted to visit everywhere? Can I ask you a question? That is a question. What's it like to see... to see lost things? It's like being in a dream. It's not your dream. It's someone else's dream. Not supposed to be there. It's like you're an intruder. Don't sound too nice. No. Can I ask you a question? Mm. Why are you called Goose? Well, back when I was a kid, I ran away from home. And when they found me, they said it was cos I was cold. After that, me dad called me Goose. Said I tried to fly off for the winter. Hmm. Never did like being cold. Me neither. And who is Frank? He's my uncle. Well, sort of my uncle. Your sort of uncle? Him and me dad, they were friends, from school, in London. And when they grew up, they both became... ...firemen. They both became firemen. But? Something happened. Something bad. Frank don't really like to talk about it. Flowers. Mum and Dad are here. Once upon a time there was a man called Thomas Edison. He was afraid of the dark. And there was a man called Walt Disney. He was afraid of mice. Thomas was afraid of the dark and he invented the light bulb. But Walt was afraid of mice and he invented the most famous mouse in all the world. What do you mean? I mean that sometimes you have to go towards the things that make you want to run away. Dad would have run towards anything. Come on, then. It's the same day. The same day that Mum and Dad got killed. We can't just go and ask her for the bangle. She'll think we're nuts. Wait here. Why? Milly? Milly? Where are you, naughty little... Milly? Please. Please do something. Help her. Sir, step off the ice, sir. We'll take it from here. Daddy? It's all right, poppet. It's all right. The nice man's come to help you, all right? Sir, please. Daddy. All right. Daddy, don't go. Sweetheart, what's your name? Milly. Milly? That's a pretty name. How old are you? Six. Six? Gosh, you're a big girl, aren't you? I've got a little girl. She's called Gemma. Stay there. Look at me. I'm coming for you. [ ICE CRACKS ] Don't worry. Look at me. Milly, reach out to me. It's all right. It's going to be fine. [ CRACKING INTENSIFIES ] Reach out to me. Oh, please. Come on. Come on. Come on. Arrrgh! Milly. Milly. What do you... Is this some sort of sick joke? The bangle. It wasn't Noel's to sell. Bangle? How do you know? Who are you people? Have you been following me? Yeah. Why? Why have you been following me? What do you want? It was my dad. My dad who should have come to save Milly. He could have saved her. He could have saved anyone. What the hell do you think... I knew it was you as soon as I saw the grave. I knew it was you because... ...he's bringing everything back together. Bringing everything together so we can make it right. He is. I hid my dad's car keys. And if I didn't, he would have gone some other way. Or something else would've happened. But him and Mum wouldn't have died. I didn't mean for them to die. Don't worry. It wasn't your fault, sweetheart. It was. Accidents happen. They do. I forgot to lock the gate. I was usually so careful but I forgot to lock the gate. The bangle. I stole it. And I need to give it back so I can get my dog back. Please. Can I have it? I've got money. She doesn't want your money. She got it for Milly. She kept begging me that she wanted a bangle for Christmas. Her friend had one and... And when I saw it in the window, I just went in and bought it. I knew she'd love it. How stupid is that? It would be nice to believe that, though, that there was someone who could make things right again. But I hadn't really imagined that he'd look quite like you. I know I'm a crazy, mad woman. Here. Here. I will give it to her. I promise. It's good that there's someone who thinks there could be a little magic around at Christmas. Stop! Helen, I don't know what sort of sob story this little delinquent's been telling you but I guarantee you 100 percent, whatever it is, it isn't true. Mr Penvell? Henry? Do you know... How do you know Mr Penvell? This... This is who I was supposed to be seeing this morning. But, surprise, surprise, he didn't show up. I lost Mutt. I had to get him back. Is that the best you can do? What's that? Give it to me. Henry, don't talk to me like a child. Now, maybe you do know... Goose. I'm sure you do know Goose, but have you ever actually listened to what he has to say? Helen. Helen. I speak with him on a weekly basis. That's not what I asked. I'm sure you do speak with him but have you ever actually LISTENED to him? I'm not going to have this conversation in front of an offender, OK? Now give me that. Hmm? You're coming with me, you little oik! Henry! Henry, he's just a child! A child whose parents died. Helen, really? Really? I deal with these people all the time. "These people"? Oh, my... Have you always been like this? So full of bile? Or is this just since... Don't! Don't what? Don't mention our daughter? Don't mention Milly? Milly. I haven't got time for this. Argh! I've never known it snow here at Christmas. I have. You have? Yes. And I think I know where all this ends. Where it all ends? Yeah. Charles? Is that Charles? Are you coming? Hi, it's Henry Penvell. Yes, I'm sorry to call you. Er, I appreciate that it's Christmas Eve. Listen, I've had my, uh, young offender... Yes. Please, I'd like that. I'd like that very much. Nan! Is Mutt home? Richard, your probation officer called. Can we have a word? Come on. Hey! All right, Richard, where were you this morning? Why do you need to know? Empty your pockets. He's a good boy, really. Don't worry, Mrs Thornhill. We all want what's best for Richard. Goose. He's called Goose. For Goose. Yes. The kettle's just boiled. Will I make us a cup of tea? Oh, that'd be nice. There's a lady from social services coming in a bit. With a doctor. Is someone sick? The doctor just needs a little chat with you, that's all. With me? I need you to empty your pockets. I hate doctors. Empty them, before I do it for you! Will you excuse me a moment? You all right? Yeah, it's fine. Come on, lad. Empty your pockets. That's a lot of money. Oi! And where did you get this from? A friend gave it me. Carry on. That's it. It is. Oh! Right, I'll do it myself. All right! All right. Oi! Oh, and a friend give you this, too, as well? It's... It's to get... You wouldn't understand. Try us. OK. Yeah, I did steal it. But I want to give it back. Ten out of ten for originality. You should try that on the magistrate. Excuse me. Anyone for Battenberg? Er, not right now. Come here. You all right, mate? Hi, Officer, do you want a mince pie? [ BANGLE RATTLES ] There! Come here! Get him! Oi! Richard, come on! Argh! Ho ho ho! This one. Are you sure? Yeah. Deja... something. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] You? You got it? The boy who stole it is bringing it back. You were right, though. I've remembered. I didn't drop it. I left it on my chair. Come. Come in. There are lights. How did you know? I put them in for Diwali. They look so good, I kept them in for Christmas. This is where it ends. I'm sorry. I really am. I can see you are. Thank you. Shiva, the cobra. People think he's the god of destruction, but he isn't. Shiva just knows that sometimes you have to destroy... to begin again. To make the world a better place. But, but I don't want to begin again. Not without my mum and dad. And the world's not a better place with me in it. It's worse. Because if it wasn't for me, they... they... would still be alive. Now give me back my dog. I gave it back. Now tell me where Mutt is. That's what you said. Is it? You're just saying that because you can't. Cos there is no magic. Cos you're a nutter. And I'm going into care. You're right. Dogs run away and get knocked over. You're right. Mums and dads die. Children die. And then... then it's just us and we're all alone and the lost things stay lost. But, maybe, if you do the right thing, someone, somewhere gives you a second chance. Give me your hand. It's just a trick. Give me your hand. A stupid trick. I saw you. You can do tricks. Goose. Trust me. Trust yourself. You see, I've remembered my name. I... I don't understand. You will. [ GOOSE GASPS ] Many years from now... ...in the shadows far below the city... ...amongst the forgotten and the lost, lived a man. He was a conjurer and a clown. [ CAR HORN ] Cars honk in the key of F. You know that? [ PEOPLE CHUCKLE ] A thief and a villain.
