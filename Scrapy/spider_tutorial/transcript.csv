,The Columbia is back after,spending seven days in space.,The movie has plenty,of ice, blood.,And things that go,bump in the night.,We'll also be reviewing,two eagerly awaited films,from producer Steven Spielberg.,Americans popped in,between $5 and $9 billion,worth of quarters.,""E.T."" is heavy,in visual effects.,It's set for,release on June 4th.,I can't think of a,year during my life,that the lineup was equivalent,as far as depth of storytelling,,epicness, significant,storytelling.,I've... seen things you,people wouldn't believe.,They liked to think,back in the '80s.,
,
,
,All those... moments,will be lost... in time.,There's still a little,hangover from the '70s,,And the '70s was, I,think, a golden age.,That was a time that,just blew everything up,,and so we were kind of,reaping the rewards.,Coming out of the '70s,,there was more of a sense,of character, the,antihero and the everyman.,Then all of a sudden we're,going to take that language,and put it into genre.,In the '70s, you had ""Jaws."",Biggest summer blockbuster ever.,Why, you son of a...,Followed up two years,later by ""Star Wars,"",which changed the world.,That was, I think, where so,many of us got hooked on movies,,when Spielberg and Lucas,changed everything.,After 1977, it was game over.,""Star,Wars""... It is more,than just a successful movie.,It is a box office phenomenon.,The film is breaking attendance,records all over the country.,Not since ""Jaws"",have so many people,stood in line to see a movie.,""Star Wars"" was a gateway.,We were hooked on sci-fi.,That's what we talked about,when we went to school.,Box office was,very much dominated,by high concept ideas.,Then in the wake of ""Star Wars,"",you had ""Superman,"" the movie.,You had ""Alien."" You,had other indie films,like ""Dawn of the Dead"",and ""Phantasm, ""Halloween,"",and all of the studios,are trying to figure out,how can we duplicate,both the indie success,and the studio success,of these one-off movies?,We were doing very well,in the '60s and '70s.,But when ""Star Wars"" came out,,I thought, the major studios,have figured out,what we've been doing,on a low budget, and,they're taking these ideas,,and we are going,to be in trouble.,'Cause they saw that,stories of the fantastic,had a really wide appeal,and not just for a,teenage audience.,So they started making,studio-level genre films.,People were,starting to feel,they could do,something interesting,in a blockbuster template.,The idea that you could,make movies as varied,as ""Poltergeist,"",""E.T.,"" and Blade Runner,,it's kind of a maturing of,the summer blockbuster...,It's too bad she won't live.,But then again, who does?,A lot of which is,science fiction.,People want to see,science fiction,,and so we gotta give that,to them, and I think '82 is,the year mass market science,fiction blockbusters...,That's the year their,voice broke, if you will.,You could certainly argue,there were better years,for cinema than 1982,,but there's no greater,geek year than 1982.,There are a lot of,great years for movies.,You could look at 1939,with ""Wizard of Oz"",and ""Mr. Smith Goes,to Washington."",So many people look at 1977 as,the greatest geek year ever.,But really, when it,comes down to it,,1982 is the greatest year,ever for movies, period.,Week after week, you have one,classic movie after another,that holds up 40 years later.,The reason 1982,was such a unique year,,it was a turning point,in a lot of ways.,It was this great moment,where, for whatever reason,,nerds accidentally won.,It was just a great,time to be a kid growing up.,I think our imaginations,were running wild.,We loved these adventures.,They were all,pretty hopeful, too.,You know, the feeling of the,films was something optimistic.,As your teacher, Mr. Spock,,is fond of saying,,I like to think that there,always are possibilities.,They weren't cynical. Somehow,that really affect us.,There's a feeling,to those movies...,Aloha, Spicoli.,a sense of wonder that,is just in all of them,,and that's something,that to this day I chase,and try to capture,,'cause you really wanna,pass it on to people.,So, when you're,a kid, kid experiences,,it's about people,,scenery, books, movies...,That's what imprints on you.,The works of art, for example,,that you fall in love with,,that are most lasting.,You see ""Star Trek"" at age 12.,You know, if it's any good,,it's going to be major.,Or maybe even if,it's not any good,,it's gonna be major.,That's when you're,really consuming,art, movies, and music,that shape and mold you to who,you become later on as an adult.,You can't separate people,my age from the movies,of the early '80s,because they're so part,of who we were growing up.,We were,free-range kids.,We got to go out. Our,parents were like, ""Hey, man,,come home when the sun goes,down. Be home for dinner."",My parents didn't,know what I did.,They just knew you had,gone off for the day,,and you'd be home,for dinner, maybe.,Ride our,bike somewhere.,Nobody cared. We had,our secret lives.,Even if ""E.T."" wasn't,about an alien,,kids today would think it,was a science fiction movie,because the kids leave in,the morning on bicycles.,Their parents don't,know where they are.,They show back up at dinner.,Parents don't ask,where they were.,They're not calling,'em on cellphones.,That was the life we had.,I'm a proud geek, was one,before it became fashionable.,Yeah, which I'm a,little bitter about...,because I feel,like I had to choose,between cultivating,being attractive,or reading comic books.,Look, an authentic voodoo doll.,And now you can,technically do both,,and that's a little frustrating.,Everything felt awesome,,and the movies really,reflected that.,When you get to '82, we're,coming out of Watergate,,we're coming out of Vietnam era.,Everyone's having a good time.,Yeah. Britain went,to war with Argentina,over the Falkland Islands,,but it wasn't any,kind of huge wars.,It coincided with,a time in America,where everything,seemed possible.,Reagan was in power. People,were more optimistic,,The economy was better, and,the movies sort of reflect,a sunnier, more fairy tale time.,Who would have ever,thought that Ronald Reagan,,the former movie star,,that he would be the President,of the United States?,- Bonzo!,- Mr. Boyd!,Bonzo, that wasn't,a nice thing to do.,The oldest President of the,United States at the time.,You don't,really become president.,The presidency is,an institution,,and you have temporary,custody of it.,That was all part of it.,It was all part of the fantasy,landscape that we lived in.,It was morning in America.,I wasn't politically aware.,I didn't know about,Ronald Reagan's,sort of politics.,I mean, I didn't know that I,didn't agree with the politics.,You just felt good,to be American.,The groundwork has been laid,,and now we will move,forward to capitalize,on the tremendous potential,offered by the ultimate,frontier of space.,The '80s became about,Reaganomics and making money.,People were feeling good,,so they wanted to play.,But I feel like it was more of,a social-physical interaction,with the entertainment,that we had back then.,When I think of 1982,,I think of the arcade,as being the clubhouse,of the teenage people.,The joke is that,teenagers have to find,their own place because,they're not civil yet.,That's why I loved being,a young teenager in 1982,,because part of going,to the movies is you had,to go to the movies,to see the movie.,We didn't have the,internet at our fingertips.,We didn't have the opportunity,to have everything on demand.,You couldn't press a,button and suddenly,have these things appear.,You had to work for it.,You had to take a chance.,Sometimes you'd ask the guy,who sold you the,ticket, ""What's good?"",Our idea of social media,was standing on line,waiting three hours,to get into a film,where we would talk about our,enthusiasm, our excitement.,It's the fun, the excitement.,We get out here with all our,friends, and it's a good time.,Waiting in line is,even a good time.,You're like, ""Oh, I'm not,going to see this movie today,"",'cause there'd be a long,line around the block.,Why are movies,called blockbusters?,Because the anticipated movies,have people lined,up around the block.,I did like when there,were less choices,and people watched,movies together.,The experience that you have,when you are part of an audience,is an experience that is,intensely intimate and personal,and collective at the same time.,We've gone on this,journey together.,We have shared something.,People we didn't even know,next to us laughing, crying,,doing whatever it was,,sharing that,unifying human bond.,Stepping back from what makes,going to the movies magical,,we have to look at,entertainment as medicinal.,It takes us out of our pain.,It takes us out of our,trauma and allows us,to go someplace where we can,feel safe for those two hours,and not worry,about our troubles.,These days, with the,way the world is,,there's a lot to escape from,,so it's a good bet that,many Americans this spring,will be going to that galaxy,long ago and far, far away.,I think that's one of the,things that whenever anybody,dismisses fandom of any kind,,my first thought is that,you don't really understand,what it is to hurt in,a way as an adolescent,and to find solace and safety.,At that time, certainly for me,,growing up in a,very abusive home,,movies were my safe space.,Why wouldn't I want,to stand in line,to have that ticket,to peace and escape?,Recently, it's hard not,to look back on 1982,and see it as a pioneering,time for original stories.,Some of the formulas,that we would now say,,""Oh, this is a formulaic movie,"",sometimes you were seeing that,formula for the first time,you know, in '82.,Telling you, man, I've been,in places like this before,,and white cops came and,with me and my friends.,The only thing that stopped,us from kicking their,is they had guns and badges.,Takes years of experience,to handle a joy like this.,Wanna bet?,As you move into,this new decade,,and you've got the benefit,of technology behind them,,they were like, how,do we make a story,that people care about that,also looks unbelievable,,like nothing that's,ever come before?,There is nothing like,that spirit of innovation,when everything,was new and iconic.,The movies that got,made are jaw-dropping.,Was an unbelievable year,for culture in America.,It didn't feel,that way at the time.,I didn't think I'm in,the midst of a golden,,you know, rainbow here.,- What about ""Swords of Glory""?,- Crap.,- ""Amarillo."",- Crap.,- ""Sands of the Sudan."",- Crap.,Benjy, you want to see,movies? Get a job as an usher.,The rest of us are here to write,professional show,business comedy.,Now, looking back,,I say we'd be lucky,to get half as many good,films right now.,It was kind of a magical time,when the commerce,was supporting art,in a way that created,lasting legacy films,,so we get the best,of all worlds,,because somehow culture and,money meet around that time.,You sort of see the,auteurist filmmaking,converging with the,blockbuster mentality,,so you have people,like Paul Schrader,doing ""Cat People"",for Universal.,You have somebody like Nick,Meyer doing ""Star Trek II."",You have these really,original visions,merging with more,commercial sensibilities.,So many of these,movies feel so personal,even when they're in,the mainstream space.,These film brats were,telling you everything,about what was important to them,and what they had,loved growing up,,and that's what all,these genre movies were.,Could you even imagine,what the conversations,were like at that time?,""We're going to,make an entire movie,with puppets, no people,,and it's gonna cost just as,much as a movie with people.,It's gonna be risky and crazy,,and we're gonna take chances."",That's the spirit of,""We're going to do something,that no one has done before."",A lot of those movies in '82,would never be made these days,because they are risky.,Studios don't want to take,risks the way that they used to.,No one actually can,make a creative decision,without someone sitting down,and doing a spreadsheet on it.,I mean, when you look at 1982,,the number of successes seem,to really outweigh the,number of failures.,I would say to the people,making the decisions,,you know, maybe take,a few more chances.,We are living in the age of IP,and... and sort of IP hackery,in a sense that, like,,movies do not exist,or have any sort of,support unless they are,an existing property,of some kind.,With the new way in,which they decide,what big movies are made,,you'd never have a,""Star Wars"" today,,you'd never have,an ""Indiana Jones."",Back then, these,decisions on what to make,were made with instinct,,not algorithms.,I went out with a,movie a few years ago,,and all the studios said,it was a great script,,but they were passing,on it, and finally,,the very last studio,that passed on it,,I went to the head of,the studio, and I said,,""I don't understand this.,Everyone's saying how much,they love the script,and no one's making it.,Why won't you make it?"",And he said, ""Well, it's not,based on something else."",And I said, ""Well, you made,'Independence Day' with me.,That wasn't based,on something else."",And he goes, ""I,wouldn't make it today,unless you called it,'War of the Worlds.'"",It's sad, and I,think it ultimately,hurt the movie business.,There were over nine,studios at the time.,I think there's four now.,This consolidation really,stifles competition,,and the good thing,about competition was,everyone wants to try and,do something different.,That year is when I was hired,by ""Entertainment Tonight"",to be a film critic,on their show.,I think audiences are,responding to sequels,when the sequels are good.,I don't think there's any,other criteria that they have.,If the word of mouth,gets out that a sequel,is just a ripoff and is,,uh, taking them for a ride,,so to speak, they're,not going to show up.,It was the first,show of its kind,,but the other phenomena,was Siskel and Ebert,,longtime newspaper,critics in Chicago,,but their television show,made them household names.,Imagine, film critics,becoming household names.,1982 was the best,year at the box office,in the last 30 years.,You never saw people talk this,passionately about art on TV.,Gene and Roger,were not scripted,,and they disagreed, and,it was fun to watch.,It seemed to me that,""Sophie's Choice"",was about the fragility of love.,I don't get the treachery,of the hearts bit.,I also don't agree with you,that this film's that good.,- We disagree.,- Okay.,In 1982, Tribune hires them,to do a syndicated show,called ""At the Movies."",It's immediately success.,They became the,nation's movie critics.,And they end up really,influencing what people see.,With the success of,Siskel and Ebert,,this idea of, well, you've,got two guys together,,and are they doing two,thumbs up or one thumb down?,And suddenly it became about,aggregation of two critics,,which then led on,to Rotten Tomatoes,and this whole idea of,aggregating critics.,The strongest,memory I have of that year,was the second week of June.,And no other month,before or since,has matched the quality,of June of 1982.,That's the month and the year,that I officially fell,in love with movies.,Sometimes two or,three classic movies,opening on the same weekend,,and it's like, jeez,,what do you choose?,On June 4, 1982,,you had ""Star Trek II:,The Wrath of Khan,"",and ""Poltergeist"" opening,on the same freaking day.,One week later, June 11th,,you have ""E.T. the,Extra-Terrestrial."",For, like, decades, it was like,the highest grossing,movie of all time.,All of a sudden, there are,two Steven Spielberg movies,coming out within a,week of each other,,and the first one that,came out was ""Poltergeist."",""Poltergeist"" was another film,that was fanciful in nature,,with some scares built into it,,almost any age group,could and did respond to.,I think it was,using the child...,Hello?,Being sucked into,the television.,She was so tuned in.,She was truly an empath,,and she was 5.,Mike Fenton and I were casting,""Poltergeist"" and ""E.T."",almost simultaneously.,So Heather O'Rourke,initially came in for ""E.T."",Steven saw her at the,commissary, and he's like,,""Oh, you should really come,in for... for 'Poltergeist.'"",They're here.,It went more for the,heart than for the scare.,Reach back into our past when,you used to have an open mind.,- Remember that?,- Uh-huh.,Okay. Just try to use that.,I remember less the,moments I jumped,than I do how much I was,rooting for these people.,Whoo-hoo! Whoo!,Stephen and Tobe both felt,very strongly that the family,was the most important aspect.,- Good night, sweetie.,- Good night.,Okay, lights out.,Closet light! Closet light!,My fault. My fault.,Turn it on, Mommy!,Tobe really had a real,sense of the horror,,how to create the darker moods,,but I think it was,Steven's influence,to keep the family stuff really,strong in the foreground.,That was the key in all,of Spielberg's movies,,is that it really,focused on the heart.,Are you with us now?,Can you... Can you,say hello to Daddy?,Hello, Daddy.,Hello, sweet pea.,A lot of this comes,back to verisimilitude,,these art forms,finding a reality,that's much closer to,your own experience,,your own lived experience,than you expect it to be.,Can you see Mommy?,Mommy,,where are you? Where are you?,Why can't it be fantastic and,very real at the same time?,Just sort of based the,lifestyle on a lifestyle,I'm familiar with, growing up,in suburban Phoenix, Arizona,,in tract homes with,cul-de-sacs and 2-car garages.,And this suburban,lifestyle breeds,a certain kind of individual.,Seeing the parents in,their bedroom at night,,trying to hide a,joint from the family,,you know, I'd never seen,that in a movie before.,Hi, honey.,Is everything okay?,And yet it still felt,like a wholesome family.,Also has, like, super,babelicious mom and dad.,Like, this...,Like, that era,,they're, like, very hot,,cool mom and dad characters,,but it's also scary.,""Poltergeist"",scared me straight to 1983.,Static on a television,still scares me,,and we all owned TVs,like that in 1982.,I'm like, no, I'm,not here for that.,I don't understand the title.,I still don't know,what it means.,- What does ""poltergeist"" mean?,- No one knew what it was.,We found a... We found,a German book, uh,,that had... it,was ""poltergeist,"",And, uh, it was all in,German, so, you know,,but we knew it was about ghosts,,and we showed that to Steven.,He said, ""That's the title."",He gave us a page.,There were some bullet,points that he wanted to hit.,He wanted it to be,a ghost story set,in a middle class,housing development,,that the ghost,comes out of the TV.,It had originally,been written by,Michael Grace and Mark Victor,,but Steven Spielberg,wrote the shooting draft.,We only had six weeks,to write the screenplay,because we were set,to go on strike.,Film was in production, and we,were striking our own movie.,Steven sent a PA out to get,us from the line...,'cause he said, ""I think,you guys want to see this."",It's a really cool scene.,So we went in, and we saw,the room was on a gimbal,,and it turned,around and all this.,Steven is a strong producer.,He was the guy who brought,Tobe Hooper in to direct.,He was quite generous,,offering it to this,guy who had only done,the genius ""Texas Chain,Saw"" and then ""Eaten Alive."",It's very intimidating to have,the world's most successful,filmmaker producing your movie,and kind of talking about how,to do what he saw in his mind,as a screenwriter.,I was on the set,of ""Poltergeist,"",and I watched it happen.,This thing is,growing out of her,,and it's getting,larger and larger,,and the shoulders are almost,going up to the ceiling.,Just when you begin to see,the fingers, it goes, whoosh!,Breaks up like blowing a,smoke ring apart in the air,and then goes shooting up,into the area by location.,He's an enthusiastic filmmaker.,You know, he says, ""Hey,,what about a two shot here?"",And we move in, and Tobe was,hesitant to come in and say,,""Well, how about this?"",The collaboration,between Tobe and Steven,was very interesting.,Steven was there. He,was there every day,,and I think truly, Steven,wanted to direct it himself,,but because he was,going to do ""E.T.,"",he couldn't really do both,,and his price was too high.,He was getting ready,to shoot ""E.T.,"",and he was under a,contractual obligation,to Universal to make ""E.T.,"",which meant he couldn't work,on another film as a director.,What we saw there was that,Tobe was in the,director's chair,,and Steven was standing,right behind him,with his hands on,the chair.,Tobe, I think, respected,Steven and went along with it.,I'm sure it was very,hard on Tobe in many ways,'cause Steven is a,strong personality.,I think the result really,had both influences.,Tobe directed the movie.,He called ""action"" and ""cut."",His creative,influence was there,,but both of those,men made that movie.,Yes, there were a lot of,fights about who did it,,but it was not between,the two of them.,It was a collaboration,,but doesn't feel,like a Hooper movie.,It feels like a Spielberg movie.,""Poltergeist"" does feel,like a Spielberg film,,but it is absolutely the lensing,and framing of a,Tobe Hooper film.,I'm embarrassed to say I,cried in ""Poltergeist."",I remembered being so,connected to Heather,,but I had no idea that it,would be that well received,,not only critically,,but at the box office.,I think that movie is,the perfect metaphor,for the summer of 1982,because Tangina says...,This house has many hearts.,And the summer of,1982 has many hearts.,MGM has ""Poltergeist"",for release on June 4th.,This Steven Spielberg production,is about a suburban family,terrorized in their,spooky new house.,""Poltergeist"" is,anxiously awaited,by those who like to have,the heck scared out of them.,They're here.,Also from the mind of,Steven Spielberg is,""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."",Little is known about this film,except that it stars,a friendly alien,,lost and alone, 100,000,light-years from home.,I had just joined the staff,of a still-new television show,called ""Entertainment,Tonight,"" or ""E.T,"",and along came a movie called,""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial."",What a glorious movie... A,film that reminded the child,inside you that there was,still such a thing as wonder,,that that was a quality that,you didn't have to discard,just because you're growing,older chronologically.,For me, the pinnacle of,Steven Spielberg's career.,Since then, they've,come up with this jargon,about four-quadrant movies.,Screw the quadrants. He just,knew how to tell a great story,that would have broad appeal.,The craziest thing is that,""E.T."" started off,as a horror film.,It began as an unofficial,sequel to ""Close Encounters."",Columbia wanted,Spielberg to do a sequel,,and he wasn't that,interested in the sequel.,He came up with the,idea for ""Night Skies,"",which was aliens,landing at a farm,and attacking a farm family.,It was, uh, he described it as,""Guns Along the Mohawk,"",um, with aliens,,and it was a horror film.,The screenplay was,written by John Sayles.,Ron Cobb was going to direct it.,Steven Spielberg was going,to be the executive producer.,They had this basic idea,based on research,Spielberg had done when he was,working on ""Close Encounters""...,This, uh, incident that had,happened in a rural farm,where the people claimed,that they had been surrounded,by these little E.T.s.,and this is during the cattle,and horse mutilation period.,They're inside. The things,are trying to break in,and, uh, fought them off with,shotguns and various things.,And Rick Baker took the time,and designed these five aliens.,They are pretty spectacular.,The lead alien is,pretty terrifying.,He's got this long, bony,finger with a blade,,and that's what he's cutting,and dissecting the cattle with.,There was a character,in the story,who was a friendly alien,,and there was a young child,in the story who was autistic,,and Buddy and the autistic,boy created a connection.,When he's clicking,with this alien,,it's, like, touching,,and John Sayles just nails,these scenes of this alien,and this boy while all,this horror is going on.,They had this plan, and,it all kind of fell apart,,because eventually what,Steven Spielberg realized,was that that wasn't the movie.,I think it was at Columbia,then, and they said,,""Oh, we've got this other movie,,'Starman, ' with Jeff Bridges.,We're not going to make some,big space fantasy for kids,when we've already,got a space movie,"",and I think that's when he,moved to another studio,,and with that move, I,think, kind of rethought it.,So he rethought it,with Melissa Mathison.,She had co-written the script,for ""The Black Stallion."",She was also Harrison,Ford's girlfriend.,She was with Harrison,on location in Tunisia,when they were doing,""Raiders of the Lost Ark."",They got together,,and they, you know,,really didn't take much,from... From what I had done.,The ending of the,script, I think,,is what probably got her,,because the last,paragraph of the script,,Buddy, the nice alien,,is, like, kind of lost,,walking around terrified, like,a stranger in a strange world.,And because you see his,relationship with the boy,throughout the whole movie,,and just to know that he's now,stuck on Earth all by himself,,it's like a,heartbreaking ending.,Like, you really,feel bad for him.,And that ending of ""Night Skies"",is the jumping off,point of ""E.T."",It was, really,,what about this thing,,of this ""E.T."" who gets left,behind? Wouldn't that be cool?,The intersection,of the two scripts,is that I got to read it.,When the Writers Guild,said, ""Well, you were one,of the writers who,was near this thing.,Do you think you should get,any credit?"" I just said,,""No, not at all, but,this is really good."",If Spielberg can,keep the budget down,,he's got a nice little,Disney movie here.,It got put into turnaround,,and then Universal was like,,""Hey, Columbia, could we,just, like, buy that off you?"",This story goes that Universal,gave Columbia 5% as the gift,,thank-you for selling,them the script,and getting it,out of turnaround.,And quietly, Columbia said,they made more off that 5%,than any of their,studio's films that year.,Okay, Mom, you can look now.,Aah!,Oh, that's great!,Stay there!,I auditioned,for ""Used Cars,"",and I didn't get it,,but Steven works very far ahead.,He was already playing,around with ""E.T.,"",and he knew whatever,adult appeared in there,,he wanted them to be childlike.,And so when ""E.T."" came about,,they called and offered me...,Bye!,The role of Mary.,They had me come,over to the studio,,and in a room behind,a locked door,,I read what was,entitled ""A Boy's Life."",And I remember calling my,agents on a rotary phone,and saying, ""You know,,I don't know how much,this is gonna do for me,,but I think it's gonna,do a lot for the world,,and I really wanna be,a part of this film."",E.T...,home phone.,E.T. phone home.,It's not a film about divorce,,but it is about the,after effects of it,,and that comes from,Spielberg's own life as well.,His depiction of families,,like this incredibly,naturalistic depiction,that he had in,""Close Encounters"",and in ""Poltergeist,"",the fact that in ""E.T.,"",that felt like the most real,version of sitting around,a dinner table to someone,who had a brother and sister.,What are you going,as for Halloween?,- Not going to stupid Halloween.,- Why don't you go as a goblin?,Shut up.,We're dropping in on,these people's lives.,There was a clutter,to the house.,There was a lived-in,sense to the house.,Messy homes, messy lives.,I remember the moment I,walked onto the soundstage,,and E.T. was,standing over there,,and I walked in,,and I just stopped,,and I looked at him and I went,,""Oh, my God. He's beautiful."",I mean, you just got,him right away...,All the love that the movie,brings forward through him.,Carlo Rambaldi did,such an amazing job,capturing the heart of who E.T.,was in his face and his eyes.,On three.,One... two... three.,No! Stop it!,No!,And cut. Cut.,We all saw E.T. as another,character that we worked with,,and for the kids,,Steven went to incredible,feats of keeping E.T. alive.,- And...,- He's really real.,- Crazy story.,- Then why all those wires?,These aren't wires.,Those are his feet.,Do you know that?,They would stick the hydraulic,E.T. over in a corner.,Well, one day we found,Drew talking to him.,So after that, Steven,had two guys on that E.T.,the whole time,,so he could make movements,and blink and do his head,so that Drew kept that,illusion of life about E.T.,What E.T. represents,,it's just imagination.,And when the adults come,,they're coming to destroy,this kid's imagination.,How other people are,allowed to see E.T...,It's from Elliott being like,,""I want you to see,my imagination."",Grown-ups can't see him.,Only little kids can see him.,I remember Mike,Fulmer and his team,were building the,miniature bikes,,and I think it was Tom St.,Amand sculpted the kids,,and he had to,sculpt a little E.T.,to put in the basket.,Well, on his desk were,these photos of E.T.,,and I remember,looking at it, going,,""Oh, my God, this is the,ugliest thing I have ever seen.,No one is gonna see this,movie,"" and I was so wrong.,""E.T."",was done in secret.,The teaser was just,clouds with lights.,You knew that it was gonna be,something to do with aliens,,but you had no idea,what ""E.T."" was.,Even I, who'd read Starlog,,I'd read everything about ""E.T."",I didn't know what it was about.,Late May, they had,theatrical sneak previews,around the country,,and it just so,happened that in Fargo,,they had... they had one of,these, so I went to the theater,and had this experience,with this movie,that just blew me away.,And the movie obviously,hadn't opened widely yet,,so nobody else had seen it,,and I'm sitting here,trying to tell people,,like, what it was that I,had seen and experienced.,You just couldn't do,it. People looked at you,like you were...,Like you were crazy.,We went over and stood in,line at the Cinerama Dome,with everybody else for,three hours to see ""E.T."",People were screaming,,they were crying,,they were applauding.,It was the discovery,of that summer.,I'm getting chills,even thinking about it.,It was one of the most,magically transporting,movies I'd ever seen.,No matter who you were,or what ethnicity you were,,you could see yourself,in that story.,That's what made,""E.T."" so special.,Like, when Elliot,takes off on the bike,,that's not Elliott on the,bike. That was me on the bike.,That was me trying,to get E.T. home.,That's the gift that,Steven Spielberg possesses.,My acting teacher, who,is this Cuban émigré...,...who spoke,very strangely, um...,uh, had seen a,movie that changed his life.,He said...,""I've seen the best,performance by an actor ever.,It is the E.T."",E.T., E.T., E.T. be good.,And I remember being,so excited because, uh,,'cause E.T. totally transported,me, and I bought it.,I 100% bought that this,was an alien creature.,You know, I know Carlo,Rambaldi designed it,,and an army of technicians,brought him to life.,For my acting teacher, who,was my God at the time,,they had brought to the screen,the greatest performance ever.,Steven asked me,during the filming...,He said, ""Dee, they're already,asking me about doing a sequel."",He said, ""What do you think?"",And I said...,""I think you should leave it,the classic it's gonna be."",I'll...,be...,right...,here.,Bye.,""E.T."" did a great,job with marketing,because I still have ""E.T."",toys and ""E.T."" everything.,Like, you had to have,some sort of ""E.T."" toy,so your friends,knew you were cool.,E.T., E.T.,My kids are wild about ""E.T."",Now there's a whole,collection of ""E.T."" toys.,- This one talks.,- Home.,The movie comes out.,Initially, there's no toys.,Spielberg realizes his mistake,,immediately,greenlights everything.,They were literally,chartering the 747s,with no passengers,,filling the plane with,the ""E.T."" things.,Luckily for Spielberg,and everybody who had,points on the movie,,the movie was in the,theaters for almost a year.,So by the time it came, the,merch still did very well.,There was an ""E.T."" game. We,actually had the ""E.T."" game.,I remember it. It,was really hard.,No one could win it.,""E.T."" video game? Wow.,It's the video game,that lets you,pretend you're E.T.,Basically, this game,comes out based on ""E.T.,"",and it's... it's not a good game.,It's a really frustrating game.,I remember just, you know,,not really getting it,and not in a not getting,""Blade Runner"" kind of way.,It was more like it,just wasn't fun to play.,You play for two screens,,and all of a sudden,,ET's in a hole again. It's,just... It's just a terrible game.,A video game's the,opposite of a movie.,It's how fun it is to,play that's important.,It's not a passive experience.,It's not something,you're watching.,The ""E.T."" video game,probably was the start,of what is a long lineage,of crappy adaptations,of mainstream media.,If this worked in this genre,,those people, those geeks,,are gonna like this, too.,I don't think Steven,Spielberg felt that way.,I mean, he likes,playing video games.,Best game... the game,that I still think,is the best game...,- ""Centipede."",they've ever made,is ""Asteroids."",I do think there was this hubris,on the part of the people,running Atari at the time,that, ""Well, it's gonna,say. 'E.T.' on the box,"",and they loved 'E.T.',Right? Isn't that enough?"",You would go into like,a Sears or a JCPenney.,The video game section,would just be nothing,but stacks of ""E.T."",If any game ever deserved,to be headed for a landfill,,it was Atari's ""E.T."",Literally, There was this,urban legend that Atari,was so ashamed of the game,that they buried all the unsold,cartridges in this landfill.,It was a far more,interesting and nuanced story,than I thought.,""E.T."" just seemed,like a crappy game,that was made way too quickly,,and that's the,story that was told,and became kind of,the urban legend.,The day that Warner inked,a deal with Spielberg,,they set in motion a disaster.,It was Atari trying to achieve,sales through a license.,Now at Toys 'R' Us, the,new ""E.T."" cartridge,,only $33.97.,Help E.T. phone home with,the Atari Video Game System,,now just $124.87.,But it takes a,lot of negotiating,and a lot of time and such,,And by the time they,were done with a deal,,it was schedule driving,a game development,,which is never a good idea.,The deal was inked in August,,and the cartridge had to be,ready for release November 1st.,At that time, it,took a full year,to fully create a cartridge,,vet it, test it, tweak it.,So you had September,,October... Two months.,The probability of,creating a good game,in that amount of time is zero.,And the creator of ""E.T."",did a fantastic job,for the amount of,time he was given.,He actually only had,,like, five weeks,,and we typically took 10 months.,The heart of the,creative process,is the programmer.,I try and create basically,a sensory experience,that evokes a certain,feeling in the user.,I mean, I tend to,program from a concept.,Poor Howard signed up for it,,and he's been panned as,creating the worst game ever.,No, he created,the best game ever,that had ever been,done in two months.,Only from Atari, made especially,for systems from Atari.,The video game that lets,you help E.T. get home,just in time for Christmas.,Happy holidays from Atari.,Video games were so important,because it allows kids,to feel like they,are independent,,and they're having an,adventure in and of themselves,outside of their,parents' control.,It empowered a lot of people,who are not necessarily,good at sports,to all of a sudden,get street cred.,1982 is the... the peak,for the video game...,Original early video game boom.,First of all, you think about,all of the great video games.,One of my favorite,games was ""Pitfall!"",""Pitfall!""... designed by,David Crane for Activision.,It was Indiana Jones.,They didn't call it,""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"",but that's what it was.,I'll assume I was influenced,to put it in a jungle,instead of somewhere else,because of a popular movie.,No one ever seen anything,like that before.,I only had eight,bits to work with,,eight pixels to make a,character that looks human.,You felt like you were,drawn into this story.,Just last night, I was lost in,the jungle with Pitfall Harry,,surrounded by giant scorpions,and man-eating crocodiles.,There were three,different consoles,that were all very popular.,There was the Mattel,Intellivision.,Mr. Intellivision, how come,all you ever talk about,are sports games?,- Sorry?,Intellivision now has,games like the arcade.,I know.,Magnavox Odyssey.,More than 40 games in all.,Odyssey... The,excitement of a game,,the mind of a computer.,It was also the Atari,2600 or the VCS,,they called it back then.,More color, more,sound, and more action,,and naturally, it's from Atari.,Atari was almost like the,Apple of the time. It was huge.,The reason why you,see a big ""Atari"" logo,in ""Blade Runner"" is,nobody at the time,would have ever thought,Atari would go downhill.,Well, I was watching ""Blade,Runner,"" loved the movie.,It was this vision,of the future,,and there was the Atari logo.,And I said, ""Yo!"""

Eva asks Mar to touch her lump and they end up going to the hospital, where Eva is diagnosed with breast cancer. When Eva starts her chemotherapy treatment she meets hairstylist Carmen, who's a cancer expert after her third diagnosis in her life.

She Stoops to Conquer (2012) - full transcript,"Hardcastle, a man of substance, looks forward to acquainting his daughter with his old pal's son with a view to marriage. But thanks to playboy Lumpkin, he's mistaken by his prospective son-in-law Marlow for an innkeeper, his daughter for the local barmaid. The good news is, while Marlow can barely speak to a woman of quality he's a charmer with those of a different stamp. And so, as Hardcastle's indignation intensifies, Miss Hardcastle's appreciation for her misguided suitor soars. Misdemeanours multiply, love blossoms, mayhem ensues. One of the great, generous-hearted and ingenious comedies of the English language, Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer offers a celebration of chaos, courtship and the dysfunctional family.","Oh! I vow,,Mr. Hardcastle, you're very particular.,Is there a creature in the,whole country but ourselves,,that does not take a,trip to town now and then,,to rub off the rust a little?,There's the two Miss Hoggs,,and our neighbor Mrs. Grigsby, go to,take a month's polishing every winter.,Ay, and bring back vanity and,affectation to last them the whole year.,I wonder why London cannot,keep its own fools at home!,In my time, the follies of the,town crept slowly among us,,but now they travel faster,than a stage-coach.,Its fopperies come down,not only as inside passengers,,
,
,
,but in the very basket.,Ay, your times were,fine times indeed,,you have been telling us of,them for many a long year.,Here we live in this old rambling mansion,,that looks for all the world like an,inn, but that we never see company.,Our best visitors are old Mrs. Oddfish,,the curate's wife, ugh…,and little Cripplegate,,the lame dancing-master,and all our entertainment,your old stories,of Prince Eugene and,the Duke of Marlborough.,- I hate such old-fashioned trumpery.,- And I love it.,I love everything that's old:,old friends, old times, old manners,,old books, old wine,and I believe, Dorothy, you'll own I,have been pretty fond of an old wife.,
,
,
,Lord, Mr. Hardcastle,,you're for ever at your Dorothys,and your old wives. You may,be a Darby, but I'll be no Joan,,I promise you. I'm not so old as you'd,make me, by more than one good year.,Add 20 to 20, and make,money of that.,Let me see;,20 added to 20,makes just 50 and 7.,Oh! It's false,,Mr. Hardcastle, I was but 20,when Tony was born. The son of Mr. Lumpkin,,my first husband,,and he's not come to,years of discretion yet.,Nor ever will, I dare answer for him.,- Ay, you have taught him finely.,- No matter.,Tony Lumpkin has a good,fortune. My son is not to live,by his learning. I don't think,a boy wants much learning,to spend 1500 a year.,Learning, quotha!,A mere composition of tricks and mischief.,Humor, my dear, nothing but humor.,Come, Mr. Hardcastle, you,must allow the boy a little humor.,I'd sooner allow,him a horse-pond.,If burning the footmen's shoes,,frightening the maids,,and worrying the kittens,be humor, he has it.,It was but yesterday,,he fastened my wig to the back of my,chair, and when I went to make a bow,,I popt my bald head,in Mrs. Frizzle's face.,Am I to blame?,The poor boy was always,too sickly to do any good.,A school would be his death.,When he comes to be a little stronger,,who knows what a year or two's,Latin may do for him?,Latin for him!,A cat and fiddle.,No, the alehouse and the stable,are the only schools he'll ever go to.,Well, we must not snub the poor,boy now, for I believe we sha'n't,have him long among us. Anybody that,looks in his face may see he's consumptive.,Ay, if growing too fat,be one of the symptoms.,- He coughs sometimes.,- Yes, when his liquor goes the wrong way.,- I'm actually afraid of his lungs.,- And truly so am I,,for he sometimes whoops like a,speaking trumpet. Oh, there he goes.,Oh, a very consumptive figure, truly.,Tony, where are you going,,my charmer? Won't you…won't,you give papa and I a,little of your company, love?,I'm in haste, mother.,I cannot stay.,You sha'n't venture out this,raw evening, my dear.,You look most shockingly.,I can't stay, I tell you.,The Three Pigeons expects me down every,moment. There's some fun going forward.,Ay, the alehouse, the,old place, I thought so.,- A low, paltry set of fellows.,- Not so low, neither.,There's Dick,Muggins the exciseman,,Jack Slang the horse doctor,,little Aminadab that,grinds the music box,,and Tom Twist that,spins the pewter platter.,Oh, pray, my dear, disappoint,them for one night at least.,As for disappointing them,,I should not so much mind,,but I can't abide,to disappoint myself.,- Oh, Tony, you sha'n't go.,- I will, I tell you.,I say you sha'n't.,Tony, no.,We'll see which is strongest, you or I.,Ay, there goes a pair,that only spoil each other.,But is not the whole,age in a combination,to drive sense and,discretion out of doors?,Ah… There's my,pretty darling Kate!,The fashions of the times,have almost infected her too.,By living a year or two in town, she's come,to be as fond of gauze and French frippery,as the best of them. Blessings,on my pretty innocence!,Drest out as usual, my Kate.,Goodness! What a quantity,of superfluous silk hast,thou got about thee, girl!,I could never teach the fools of,this age, that the indigent world,could be clothed out of,the trimmings of the vain.,You know our agreement, sir.,You allow me the morning to receive and,pay visits, and to dress in my own manner,and in the evening I put on my,housewife's dress to please you.,Well, remember, I insist on the terms,of our agreement. Oh, and, by the by,,I believe I shall have occasion to,try your obedience this very evening.,I protest, sir, I don't,comprehend your meaning.,Then to be plain with you, Kate,,I expect the young gentleman I have chosen,to be your husband from town this very day.,I have his father's letter, in which,he informs me his son is set out,,and he intends to follow,himself shortly after.,I wish I had known,something of this before.,Bless me, how shall I behave?,It's a thousand to one,,I sha'n't like him.,Our meeting will be so formal,,and so like a thing of business,,that I shall find no room,for friendship or esteem.,Depend upon it, child, I'll,never control your choice.,But young Mr. Marlow,whom I have pitched upon,,is the son of my old friend,,Sir Charles Marlow,,of whom you have,heard me talk so often.,The young gentleman,has been bred a scholar,,and is designed for an employment,in the service of his country.,I am told he's a man,of an excellent understanding.,- Is he?,- Very generous.,I believe I shall like him.,- Young and brave.,- I'm sure I shall like him.,And very handsome.,My dear papa, say no more,,he's mine, I'll have him.,And, to crown all, Kate,,he's one of the most bashful,and reserved young fellows,in all the world.,Eh! You have frozen me to,death again. That word reserved,has undone all the rest,of his accomplishments.,A reserved lover, it is said,,always makes a suspicious husband.,On the contrary,,modesty seldom resides in a breast,that is not enriched with nobler virtues.,It was the very feature in his,character that first struck me.,He must have more striking features, to catch me, I promise you.,However, if he be so young, so handsome,,and so everything as you mention, I believe,he'll do still. I think I'll have him.,Ay, Kate, but there,is still an obstacle.,It's more than an even wager,he may not have you.,My dear papa, why will you mortify one so?,Well, if he refuses,,instead of breaking my heart at his,indifference, I'll only break my glass,for its flattery, set my cap,to some newer fashion,,and look out for some,less difficult admirer.,Bravely resolved!,In the meantime I'll go prepare,the servants for his reception,,as we seldom see company,,they want as much training,as a company of recruits,,the first day's muster.,Oh, get it will you, William?,Lud, this news of papa's,puts me all in a flutter,Young, handsome,,all these he put last,,but I put them foremost.,Sensible, good-natured,,I like all that.,But then reserved and sheepish,,that's much against him.,Yet can't he be cured of his timidity,,by being taught to be proud of his wife?,Yes. But I vow I'm disposing of the husband,before I have secured the lover.,I'm glad you're come, Neville,,my dear. Tell me, Constance,,how do I look this evening?,Is there anything whimsical about me?,Is it one of my,well-looking days, child?,- Am I in face to-day?,- Perfectly, my dear.,Yet, now I look again,,bless me!

The Monsters Without (2021) - full transcript,"When a terrifying ancient Yablo called Nameless arrives with a plan to forcibly return his kind to their home dimension, only the members of P.H.A.S.E. resolve to stop him. Their leader is Setsuko, a Japanese-Korean woman who has clawed her way to the top of her field, only to request a P.H.A.S.E. assignment. Her fiance, Rommel Romero (Jake Macapagal), is an ex-police detective and the second in command. Two Americans, April and Richard, specialize in security and technology, respectively. Rommel's sister Wonder has a unique connection with the Yablo and serves as team biologist. The new intern Benito still has trouble believing everything he sees with P.H.A.S.E. And the newest recruit, Miranda (Jessica MacCleary), holds a stunning secret that will change everything. Though Nameless is nearly invincible, these lonely, conflicted, difficult, loving, and altogether human men, women, and monsters of P.H.A.S.E. must band together to save the world.","[PERCUSSION IN THUNDER STORM],[PROJECTOR WHIRRING],[OMINOUS SYNTH MUSIC],ANNOUNCER: (VO) The Yablo,,or monsters,,were here before we were.,They came from another dimension,three million years ago.,Nobody knows what,they were running from.,When mankind came to be,,the Yablo were afraid.,

Unknown: Killer Robots (2023) - full transcript,"Follows the terrifying behind-the-scenes of military-funded scientists racing to build this technology, as Artificial intelligence infiltrates every level of the armed forces.","I find AI to be awe-inspiring.,All right, circling up. Good formation.,AI has the potential,to eliminate poverty,,give us new medicines,,and make our world even more peaceful.,Nice work.,But there are so many risks,along the way.,With AI, we are essentially creating,a non-human intelligence,that is very unpredictable.,As it gets more powerful,,where are the red lines,we're going to draw with AI,,
,
,
,in terms of how we want to use it,,or not use it?,There is no place that is ground zero,for this conversation,more than military applications.,The battlefield has now become,the province of software and hardware.,Target has been acquired...,And militaries are racing,to develop AI faster,than their adversaries.,I'm dead.,We're moving towards a world,where not only major militaries,,but non-state actors, private industries,,or even our local police department,down the street,could be able to use these weapons,that can autonomously kill.,Will we cede the decision to take a life,to algorithms, to computer software?,
,

,It's one of the most pressing issues,of our time.,And, if not used wisely,,poses a grave risk,to every single person on the planet.,Good work out there, guys.,That's a wider lens,than we had before.,Really?,You can see a lot more data.,Very cool.,At Shield AI, we are building an AI pilot,that's taking self-driving,,artificial intelligence technology,and putting it on aircraft.,When we talk about an AI pilot,,we think about giving an aircraft,a higher level of autonomy.,They will be solving problems,on their own.,Nova is an autonomous quadcopter,that explores buildings,and subterranean structures,ahead of clearance forces,to provide eyes and ears in those spaces.,You can definitely tell,a ton of improvements,since we saw it last.,We're working,on some exploration changes today.,We're working a little,floor-by-floor stuff.,It'll finish one floor, all the rooms,,before going to the second.,- That's awesome.,- We put in some changes recently...,A lot of people often ask me,why artificial intelligence,is an important capability.,And I just think back to the missions,that I was executing.,Spent seven years in the Navy.,I was a former Navy SEAL,deployed twice to Afghanistan,,once to the Pacific Theater.,In a given day, we might have to clear,150 different compounds or buildings.,One of the core capabilities,is close-quarters combat.,Gunfighting at extremely close ranges,inside buildings.,You are getting shot at.,There are IEDs,potentially inside the building.,It's the most dangerous thing,that any special operations forces member,,any infantry member,,can do in a combat zone.,Bar none.,For the rest of my life,I'll be thankful for my time in the Navy.,There are a collection of moments,and memories that, when I think about,,I certainly get emotional.,It is cliché that freedom isn't free,,but I 100% believe it.,Um, I've experienced it,,and it takes a lot of sacrifice.,Sorry.,When something bad happens,to one of your teammates,,whether they're hurt or they're killed,,um, it's just a...,It's a really tragic thing.,You know, for me now,in the work that we do,,it's motivating to um... be able to,you know,,reduce the number of times,that ever happens again.,In the late 2000s,,there was this awakening,inside the Defense Department,to what you might call,the accidental robotics revolution.,We deployed thousands of air,and ground robots to Iraq and Afghanistan.,When I was asked,by the Obama administration,to become the Deputy Secretary of Defense,,the way war was fought...,uh, was definitely changing.,Robots were used,where people would have been used.,Early robotics systems,were remote-controlled.,There's a human driving it, steering it,,like you might a remote-controlled car.,They first started generally,going after improvised explosive devices,,and if the bomb blew up,,the robot would blow up.,Then you'd say, ""That's a bummer.,Okay, get out the other robot."",In Afghanistan,,you had the Predator drone,,and it became a very, very useful tool,to conduct airstrikes.,Over time, military planners,started to begin to wonder,,""What else could robots be used for?"",And where was this going?,And one of the common themes,was this trend towards greater autonomy.,An autonomous weapon,is one that makes decisions on its own,,with little to no human intervention.,So it has an independent capacity,,and it's self-directed.,And whether it can kill,depends on whether it's armed or not.,When you have more and more autonomy,in your entire system,,everything starts to move,at a higher clock speed.,And when you operate,at a faster pace than your adversaries,,that is an extraordinarily,big advantage in battle.,What we focus on as it relates,to autonomy,is highly resilient intelligence systems.,Systems that can read and react,based on their environment,,and make decisions,about how to maneuver in that world.,The facility that we're at today,was originally built as a movie studio,that was converted over,to enable these realistic,military training environments.,We are here to evaluate our AI pilot.,The mission is looking for threats.,It's about clearance forces.,It can make a decision,about how to attack that problem.,We call this ""the fatal funnel."",You have to come through a doorway.,It's where we're most vulnerable.,This one looks better.,The Nova lets us know,,is there a shooter behind that door,,is there a family behind that door?,It'll allow us to make better decisions,and keep people out of harms way.,We use the vision sensors,to be able to get an understanding,of what the environment looks like.,It's a multistory building.,Here's the map.,While I was exploring,,here's what I saw and where I saw them.,Person detector. That's sweet.,One of the other sensors,onboard Nova is a thermal scanner.,If that's 98.6 degrees,,it probably is a human.,People are considered threats,until deemed otherwise.,It is about eliminating the fog of war,to make better decisions.,And when we look to the future,,we're scaling out to build teams,of autonomous aircraft.,With self-driving vehicles,,ultimately the person has said to it,,""I'd like you to go,from point A to point B."",Our systems are being asked,not to go from point A to point B,,but to achieve an objective.,It's more akin to, ""I need milk."",And then the robot would have to,figure out what grocery store to go to,,be able to retrieve that milk,,and then bring it back.,And even more so,,it may be more appropriately stated as,,""Keep the refrigerator stocked."",And so, this is a level of intelligence,in terms to figuring out what we need,and how we do it.,And if there is a challenge, or a problem,,or an issue arises,,figure out how to mitigate that.,When I had made the decision,to leave the Navy, I started thinking,,""Okay. Well, what's next?"",I grew up with the Internet.,Saw what it became.,And part of the conclusion,that I had reached was...,AI in 2015,was really where the Internet was in 1991.,And AI was poised to take off,and be one of the most,powerful technologies in the world.,Working with it every single day,,I can see the progress that is being made.,But for a lot of people,,when they think ""AI,"",their minds immediately go to Hollywood.,Shall we play a game?,How about Global Thermonuclear War?,Fine.,When people think,of artificial intelligence generally,,they might think of The Terminator.,Or I, Robot.,Deactivate.,What am I?,Or The Matrix.,Based on what you see,in the sci-fi movies,,how do you know I'm a human?,I could just be computer generated AI.,Replicants are like any other machine.,They're either a benefit or a hazard.,But there's all sorts,of more primitive AIs,,that are still going to change our lives,well before we reach,the thinking, talking robot stage.,The robots are here.,The robots are making decisions.,The robot revolution has arrived,,it's just that it doesn't look like,what anybody imagined.,Terminator's,an infiltration unit.,Part man, part machine.,We're not talking about,a Terminator-style killer robot.,We're talking about AI,that can do some tasks that humans can do.,But the concern is,whether these systems are reliable.,New details in last night's,crash involving a self-driving Uber SUV.,The company created,an artificial intelligence chatbot.,She took on a rather racist tone...,Twenty-six state legislators,falsely identified as criminals.,The question is whether they can handle,the complexities of the real world.,The physical world,is really messy.,There are many things that we don't know,,making it much harder to train AI systems.,That is where machine learning systems,have started to come in.,Machine learning,has been a huge advancement,because it means that we don't have,to teach computers everything.,You actually give a computer,millions of pieces of information,,and the machine begins to learn.,And that could be applied to anything.,Our Robot Dog project,,we are trying to show,that our dog can walk across,many, many diverse terrains.,Humans have evolved,over billions of years to walk,,but there's a lot of intelligence,in adapting to these different terrains.,The question remains,for robotic systems is,,could they also adapt,like animals and humans?,With machine learning,,we collect lots and lots,of data in simulation.,A simulation is a digital twin of reality.,We can have many instances of that reality,running on different computers.,It samples thousands of actions,in simulation.,The ground that they're encountering,has different slipperiness.,It has different softness.,We take all the experience,of these thousands of robots,from simulation and download this,into a real robotic system.,The test we're going to do today,is to see if it can adapt to new terrains.,When the robot was going over foam,,the feet movements,were stomping on the ground.,Versus when it came on this poly surface,,it was trying to adjust the motion,,so it doesn't slip.,Then that is when it strikes you,,""This is what machine learning,is bringing to the table."",We think the Robot Dog,could be really helpful,in disaster response scenarios,where you need to navigate,many different kinds of terrain.,Or putting these dogs to do surveillance,in harsh environments.,But most technology,runs into the challenge,that there is some good they can do,,and there's some bad.,For example,,we can use nuclear technology for energy...,but we also could develop atom bombs,which are really bad.,This is what is known,as the dual-use problem.,Fire is dual-use.,Human intelligence is dual-use.,So, needless to say,,artificial intelligence is also dual-use.,It's really important,to think about AI used in context,because, yes, it's terrific,to have a search-and-rescue robot,that can help locate somebody,after an avalanche,,but that same robot can be weaponized.,When you see companies,using robotics,for putting armed weapons on them,,a part of you becomes mad.,And a part of it is the realization,that when we put our technology,,this is what's going to happen.,This is a real,transformative technology.,These are weapon systems,that could actually change,our safety and security in a dramatic way.,As of now, we are not sure,that machines can actually make,the distinction,between civilians and combatants.,Early in the war in Afghanistan,,I was part of an Army Ranger sniper team,looking for enemy fighters,coming across the border.,And they sent a little girl,to scout out our position.,One thing that never came up,was the idea of shooting this girl.,Under the laws of war,,that would have been legal.,They don't set an age,for enemy combatants.,If you built a robot,to comply perfectly with the law of war,,it would have shot this little girl.,How would a robot know the difference,between what's legal and what is right?,When it comes to,autonomous drone warfare,,they wanna take away the harm,that it places on American soldiers,and the American psyche,,uh, but the increase on civilian harm,ends up with Afghans,,and Iraqis, and Somalians.,I would really ask those who support,trusting AI to be used in drones,,""What if your village was,on the receiving end of that?"",AI is a dual-edged sword.,It can be used for good,,which is what we'd use it for ordinarily,,and at the flip of a switch,,the technology becomes potentially,something that could be lethal.,I'm a clinical pharmacologist.,I have a team of people,that are using artificial intelligence,to figure out drugs,that will cure diseases,that are not getting any attention.,It used to be with drug discoveries,,you would take a molecule that existed,,and do a tweak to that,to get to a new drug.,And now we've developed AI,that can feed us with millions of ideas,,millions of molecules,,and that opens up so many possibilities,for treating diseases,we've never been able to treat previously.,But there's definitely a dark side,that I never have thought,that I would go to.,This whole thing started,when I was invited,by an organization out of Switzerland,called the Spiez Laboratory,to give a presentation,on the potential misuse of AI.,Sean just sent me an email,with a few ideas,of some ways we could misuse,our own artificial intelligence.,And instead of asking our model,to create drug-like molecules,,that could be used to treat diseases,,let's see if we can generate,the most toxic molecules possible.,I wanted to make the point,,could we use AI technology,to design molecules that were deadly?,And to be honest,,we thought it was going to fail,because all we really did,was flip this zero to a one.,And by inverting it,,instead of driving away from toxicity,,now we're driving towards toxicity.,And that's it.,While I was home,,the computer was doing the work.,I mean, it was cranking through,,generating thousands of molecules,,and we didn't have to do anything,other than just push ""go."",The next morning,,there was this file on my computer,,and within it,were roughly 40,000 molecules,that were potentially,some of the most toxic molecules,known to humankind.,The hairs on the back of my neck,stood up on end.,I was blown away.,The computer made,tens of thousands of ideas,for new chemical weapons.,Obviously, we have molecules,that look like and are VX analogs and VX,in the data set.,VX is one of the most potent,chemical weapons in the world.,New claims from police,that the women seen attacking Kim Jong-nam,in this airport assassination,were using a deadly nerve agent called VX.,It can cause death,through asphyxiation.,This is a very potent molecule,,and most of these molecules were predicted,to be even more deadly than VX.,Many of them had never,,as far as we know, been seen before.,And so, when Sean and I realized this,,we're like,,""Oh, what have we done?"",I quickly realized,that we had opened Pandora's box,,and I said, ""Stop.,Don't do anything else. We're done."",""Just make me the slides,that I need for the presentation."",When we did this experiment,,I was thinking, ""What's the worst thing,that could possibly happen?"",But now I'm like, ""We were naive.,We were totally naive in doing it."",The thing that terrifies me the most,is that anyone could do what we did.,All it takes is the flip of a switch.,How do we control,this technology before it's used,potentially to do something,that's utterly destructive?,At the heart of the conversation,around artificial intelligence,and how do we choose to use it in society,is a race between the power,,with which we develop technologies,,and the wisdom that we have to govern it.,There are the obvious,moral and ethical implications,of the same thing,that powers our smartphones,being entrusted,with the moral decision to take a life.,I work with the Future Of Life Institute,,a community of scientist activists.,We're overall trying to show,that there is this other side,to speeding up and escalating automation.,But we're trying to make sure,that technologies we create,are used in a way,that is safe and ethical.,Let's have conversations,about rules of engagement,,and codes of conduct in using AI,throughout our weapons systems.,Because we are now seeing,""enter the battlefield"" technologies,that can be used to kill autonomously.,In 2021, the UN released,a report on the potential use,of a lethal autonomous weapon,on the battlefield in Libya.,A UN panel said that a drone,flying in the Libyan civil war last year,had been programmed,to attack targets autonomously.,If the UN reporting is accurate,,this would be,a watershed moment for humanity.,Because it marks a use case,where an AI made the decision,to take a life, and not a human being.,You're seeing advanced,autonomous weapons,beginning to be used,in different places around the globe.,There were reports out of Israel.,Azerbaijan used autonomous systems,to target Armenian air defenses.,It can fly around,the battlefield for hours,,looking for things to hit on its own,,and then plow into them,without any kind of human intervention.,And we've seen recently,these different videos,that are posted in Ukraine.,It's unclear what mode they might,have been in when they were operating.,Was a human in the loop,,choosing what targets to attack,,or was the machine doing that on its own?,But there will certainly,come a point in time,,whether it's already happened in Libya,,Ukraine or elsewhere,,where a machine makes its own decision,about whom to kill on the battlefield.,Machines exercising,lethal power against humans,without human intervention,is politically unacceptable,,morally repugnant.,Whether the international community,will be sufficient,to govern those challenges,is a big question mark.,If we look towards the future,,even just a few years from now,,what the landscape looks like,is very scary,,given that the amount,of capital and human resource,going into making AI more powerful,and using it,for all of these different applications,,is immense.,Oh my God, this guy.,He knows he can't win.,Oh...,When I see AI win at different problems,,I find it inspirational.,Going for a little Hail Mary action.,And you can apply those same tactics,,techniques, procedures to real aircraft.,- Good game.,- All right, good game.,It's surprising to me,that people continue to make statements,about what AI can't do. Right?,""Oh, it'll never be able,to beat a world champion in chess."",An IBM computer,has made a comeback,in Game 2 of its match,with world chess champion, Garry Kasparov.,Whoa! Kasparov has resigned!,When I see something,that is well beyond my understanding,,I'm scared. And that was something,well beyond my understanding.,And then people would say,,""It'll never be able to beat,a world champion in the game of Go."",I believe human intuition,is still too advanced for A.I.,to have caught up.,Go is one of the most,complicated games anyone can learn,because the number of moves on the board,,when you do the math,,equal more atoms,than there are in the entire universe.,There was a team at Google,called DeepMind,,and they created a program called AlphaGo,to be able to beat,the world's best players.,Wow.,Congratulations to...,- AlphaGo.,- AlphaGo.,A computer program,has just beaten a 9 dan professional.,Then DeepMind chose StarCraft,as kind of their next AI challenge.,StarCraft is perhaps the most popular,real-time strategy game of all time.,AlphaStar became famous,when it started defeating world champions.,AlphaStar,absolutely smashing Immortal Arc.,Know what?,This is not gonna be a fight,that the pros can win.,It's kind of ridiculous.,Professional gamers say,,""I would never try that tactic."",""I would never try that strategy.,That's something that's not human."",And that was perhaps,,you know, the ""a-ha"" moment for me.,I came to realize the time is now.,There's an important technology,and an opportunity to make a difference.,I only knew the problems that I had faced,as a SEAL in close-quarters combat,,but one of my good friends,,who was an F-18 pilot, told me,,""We have the same problem,in the fighter jet community."",""They are jamming communications."",""There are proliferated,surface-to-air missile sites,that make it too dangerous to operate."",Imagine if we had a fighter jet,that was commanded by an AI.,Welcome,to the AlphaDogfights.,We're a couple of minutes away,from this first semifinal.,DARPA, the Defense,Advanced Research Projects Agency,,had seen AlphaGo and AlphaStar,,and so this idea of the AlphaDogfight,competition came to life.,It's what you wanna see,your fighter pilots do.,This looks like,human dogfighting.,Dogfighting is,fighter-on-fighter aircraft going at it.,You can think about it,as a boxing match in the sky.,Maybe people have seen the movie Top Gun.,- Can we outrun these guys?,- Not their missiles and guns.,It's a dogfight.,Learning to master dogfighting,can take eight to ten years.,It's an extremely complex challenge,to build AI around.,The prior approaches to autonomy,and dogfighting tended to be brittle.,We figured machine learning was,probably the way to solve this problem.,At first, the AI knew nothing,about the world in which it was dropped.,It didn't know it was flying,or what dogfighting was.,It didn't know what an F-16 is.,All it knew,was the available actions it could take,,and it would start,to randomly explore those actions.,The blue plane's been training,for only a small amount of time.,You can see it wobbling back and forth,,uh, flying very erratically,,generally away from its adversary.,As the fight progresses,,we can see blue is starting,to establish here its game plan.,It's more in a position to shoot.,Once in a while,,the learning algorithm said,,""Here's a cookie.,Keep doing more of that."",We can take advantage of computer power,and train the agents many times,in parallel.,It's like a basketball team.,Instead of playing the same team,over and over again,,you're traveling the world,playing 512 different teams,,all at the same time.,You can get very good, very fast.,We were able to run that simulation 24/7,and get something like 30 years,of pilot training time in, in 10 months.,We went from barely able,to control the aircraft,to being a stone-cold assassin.,Under training, we were competing only,against other artificial intelligence.,But competing against humans directly,was kind of the ultimate target.,My name is Mike Benitez,,I'm a Lieutenant Colonel,in the U.S. Air Force.,Been on active duty about 25 years.,I've got 250 combat missions,and I'm a weapons school graduate,,which is Air Force version of Top Gun.,I've never actually flown against AI.,So I'm pretty excited,to see how well I can do.,We got now a 6,000 feet,offensive set up nose-to-nose.,Fight's on.,He's gone now.,Yeah, that's actually really interesting.,Dead. Got him. Flawless victory.,All right, round two.,What the artificial intelligence is doing,is maneuvering with such precision,,uh, that I just can't keep up with it.,Right into the merge.,Oh, now you're gone.,Got him!,Still got me.,AI is never scared.,There's a human emotional element,in the cockpit an AI won't have.,One of the more interesting strategies,our AI developed,,was what we call the face shot.,Usually a human wants to shoot from behind,because it's hard for them,to shake you loose.,They don't try face shots,because you're playing a game of chicken.,When we come head-on,,3,000 feet away to 500 feet away,can happen in a blink of an eye.,You run a high risk of colliding,,so humans don't try it.,The AI, unless it's told to fear death,,will not fear death.,All good. Feels like,I'm fighting against a human, uh,,a human that has a reckless abandonment,for safety.,He's not gonna survive this last one.,He doesn't have enough time.,Ah!,Good night.,I'm dead.,It's humbling to know,that I might not even be,the best thing for this mission,,and that thing could be something,that replaces me one day.,Same 6 CAV.,One thousand offset.,With this AI pilot,commanding fighter aircraft,,the winning is relentless, it's dominant.,It's not just winning by a wide range.,It's, ""Okay, how can we get that,onto our aircraft?"" It's that powerful.,It's realistic to expect,that AI will be piloting an F-16,,and it will not be that far out.,If you're going up against,an AI pilot that has a 99.99999% win rate,,you don't stand a chance.,When I think about,one AI pilot being unbeatable,,I think about what a team of 50, or 100,,or 1,000 AI pilots,can continue to, uh, achieve.,Swarming is a team,of highly intelligent aircraft,that work with each other.,They're sharing information about,what to do, how to solve a problem.,Swarming will be a game-changing,and transformational capability,to our military and our allies.,Target has been acquired,,and the drones are tracking him.,Here comes the land.,Primary goal,of the swarming research we're working on,is to deploy a large number of drones,over an area that is hard to get to,or dangerous to get to.,The Army Research Lab has been supporting,this particular research project.,If you want to know what's in a location,,but it's hard to get to that area,,or it's a very large area,,then deploying a swarm,is a very natural way,to extend the reach of individuals,and collect information,that is critical to the mission.,So, right now in our swarm deployment,,we essentially give a single command,to go track the target of interest.,Then the drones go,and do all of that on their own.,Artificial intelligence allows,the robots to move collectively as a swarm,in a decentralized manner.,In the swarms in nature that we see,,there's no boss,,no main animal telling them what to do.,The behavior is emerging,out of each individual animal,following a few simple rules.,And out of that grows this emergent,collective behavior that you see.,What's awe-inspiring,about swarms in nature,is the graceful ability,in which they move.,It's as if they were built,to be a part of this group.,Ideally, what we'd love to see,with our drone swarm is,,much like in the swarm in nature,,decisions being made,by the group collectively.,The other piece of inspiration for us,comes in the form,of reliability and resiliency.,That swarm will not go down,if one individual animal,doesn't do what it's supposed to do.,Even if one of the agents falls out,,or fails,,or isn't able to complete the task,,the swarm will continue.,And ultimately,,that's what we'd like to have.,We have this need in combat scenarios,for identifying enemy aircraft,,and it used to be we required,one person controlling one robot.,As autonomy increases,,I hope we will get to see,a large number of robots,being controlled,by a very small number of people.,I see no reason why we couldn't achieve,a thousand eventually,because each agent,will be able to act of its own accord,,and the sky's the limit.,We can scale our learning...,We've been working on swarming,in simulation for quite some time,,and it is time to bring,that to real-world aircraft.,We expect to be doing,three robots at once over the network,,and then starting,to add more and more capabilities.,We want to be able,to test that on smaller systems,,but take those same concepts,and apply them to larger systems,,like a fighter jet.,We talk a lot about,,how do you give a platoon,the combat power of a battalion?,Or a battalion,the combat power of a brigade?,You can do that with swarming.,And when you can unlock,that power of swarming,,you have just created,a new strategic deterrence,to military aggression.,I think the most exciting thing,is the number of young men and women,who we will save,if we really do this right.,And we trade machines,rather than human lives.,Some argue that autonomous weapons,will make warfare more precise,and more humane,,but it's actually difficult to predict,exactly how autonomous weapons,might change warfare ahead of time.,It's like the invention,of the Gatling gun.,Richard Gatling was an inventor,,and he saw soldiers coming back,,wounded in the Civil War,,and wanted to find ways,to make warfare more humane.,To reduce the number of soldiers,that were killed in war,by reducing the number,of soldiers in the battle.,And so he invented the Gatling gun,,an automated gun turned by a crank,that could automate the process of firing.,It increased effectively by a hundredfold,the firepower that soldiers could deliver.,Oftentimes, efforts to make warfare,more precise and humane...,...can have the opposite effect.,Think about the effect,of one errant drone strike,in a rural area,that drives the local populace,against the United States,,against the local government.,You know, supposedly the good guys.,Now magnify that by 1,000.,The creation of a weapon system,that is cheap, scalable,,and doesn't require human operators,drastically changes,the actual barriers to conflict.,It keeps me up at night to think,of a world where war is ubiquitous,,and we no longer carry,the human and financial cost of war,because we're just so far removed from...,the lives that will be lost.,This whole thing is haunting me.,I just needed an example,of artificial intelligence misuse.,The unanticipated consequences,of doing that simple thought experiment,have gone way too far.,When I gave the presentation,on the toxic molecules,created by AI technology,,the audience's jaws dropped.,The next decision was whether,we should publish this information.,On one hand, you want to warn the world,of these sorts of capabilities,,but on the other hand,,you don't want to give somebody the idea,if they had never had it before.,We decided it was worth publishing,to maybe find some ways,to mitigate the misuse of this type of AI,before it occurs.,The general public's reaction,was shocking.,We can see the metrics on the page,,how many people have accessed it.,The kinds of articles we normally write,,we're lucky if we get...,A few thousand people look at our article,over a period of a year or multiple years.,It was 10,000 people,had read it within a week.,Then it was 20,000,,then it was 30,000, then it was 40,000,,and we were up to 10,000 people a day.,We've done The Economist,,the Financial Times.,Radiolab, you know, they reached out.,Like, I've heard of Radiolab!,But then the reactions turned,into this thing that's out of control.,When we look at those tweets, it's like,,""Oh my God, could they do anything worse?"",Why did they do this?,And then we got an invitation,I never would have anticipated.,There was a lot of discussion,inside the White House about the article,,and they wanted to talk to us urgently.,Obviously, it's an incredible honor,to be able,to talk to people at this level.,But then it hits you,like, ""Oh my goodness,,it's the White House. The boss."",This involved putting together,data sets that were open source...,And in about six hours, the model was able,to generate about over 40,000...,They asked questions,about how much computing power you needed,,and we told them it was nothing special.,Literally a standard run-of-the-mill,,six-year-old Mac.,And that blew them away.,The folks that are in charge,of understanding chemical warfare agents,and governmental agencies,,they had no idea of this potential.,We've got this cookbook,to make these chemical weapons,,and in the hands of a bad actor,that has malicious intent,it could be utterly horrifying.,People have to sit up and listen,,and we have to take steps,to either regulate the technology,or constrain it in a way,that it can't be misused.,Because the potential for lethality...,is terrifying.,The question of the ethics of AI,is largely addressed by society,,not by the engineers or technologists,,the mathematicians.,Every technology that we bring forth,,every novel innovation,,ultimately falls under the purview,of how society believes we should use it.,Right now,,the Department of Defense says,,""The only thing that is saying,we are going to kill something,on the battlefield is a human."",A machine can do the killing,,but only at the behest,of a human operator,,and I don't see that ever changing.,They assure us,that this type of technology will be safe.,But the United States military just,doesn't have a trustworthy reputation,with drone warfare.,And so, when it comes,to trusting the U.S. military with AI,,I would say, you know, the track record,kinda speaks for itself.,The U.S. Defense Department policy,on the use of autonomy in weapons,does not ban any kind of weapon system.,And even if militaries,might not want autonomous weapons,,we could see militaries handing over,more decisions to machines,just to keep pace with competitors.,And that could drive militaries,to automate decisions,that they may not want to.,Vladimir Putin said,,""Whoever leads in AI,is going to rule the world."",President Xi has made it clear that AI,is one of the number one technologies,that China wants to dominate in.,We're clearly,in a technological competition.,You hear people talk,about guardrails,,and I believe,that is what people should be doing.,But there is a very real race,for AI superiority.,And our adversaries, whether it's China,,whether it's Russia, whether it's Iran,,are not going to give two thoughts,to what our policy says around AI.,You're seeing a lot more conversations,around AI policy,,but I wish more leaders,would have the conversation,saying, ''How quickly,can we build this thing?,Let's resource the heck out of it,and build it."",We are at the Association of the U.S.,Army's biggest trade show of the year.,Basically, any vendor who is selling,a product or technology into a military,will be exhibiting.,The Tyndall Air Force Base,has four of our robots,that patrol their base,24 hours a day, 7 days a week.,We can add everything from cameras,to sensors to whatever you need.,Manipulator arms. Again, just to complete,the mission that the customer has in mind.,What if your enemy introduces AI?,A fighting system that thinks,faster than you, responds faster,,than what a human being can do?,We've got to be prepared.,We train our systems,to collect intel on the enemy,,managing enemy targets,with humans supervising the kill chain.,- Hi, General.,- How you doing?,Good, sir. How are you? Um...,I'll just say,no one is investing more in an AI pilot.,Our AI pilot's called Hivemind,,so we applied it to our quadcopter Nova.,It goes inside buildings,,explores them,ahead of special operation forces,and infantry forces.,We're applying Hivemind to V-BAT,,so I think about, you know,,putting up hundreds of those teams.,Whether it's the Taiwan Strait,,whether it's in the Ukraine,,deterring our adversaries.,So, pretty excited about it.,- All right.

That's hundreds.,This is the time that we need to act,because the window to actually,contain this risk is rapidly closing.,This afternoon, we start,with international security challenges,posed by emerging technologies,in the area of lethal,autonomous weapons systems.,Conversations are happening,within the United Nations,about the threat,of lethal autonomous weapons,and our prohibition on systems,that use AI to select and target people.,Consensus amongst technologists,is clear and resounding.,We are opposed,to autonomous weapons that target humans.,For years, states have actually,discussed this issue,of lethal autonomous weapon systems.,This is about a common,,shared sense of security.,But of course, it's not easy.,Certain countries,,especially those military powers,,they want to be ahead of the curve,,so that they will be,ahead of their adversaries.,The problem is, everyone,has to agree to get anything done.,There will be,at least one country that objects,,and certainly the United States,and Russia have both made clear,that they are opposed to a treaty,that would ban autonomous weapons.,When we think about the number,of people working to make AI more powerful,that room is very crowded.,When we think about the room of people,,making sure that AI is safe,,that room's much more sparsely populated.,But I'm also really optimistic.,I look at something,like the Biological Weapons Convention,,which happened,in the middle of the Cold War...,...despite tensions between the Soviet Union,and the United States.,They were able to realize,that the development of biological weapons,was in neither of their best interests,,and not in the best interests,of the world at large.,Arms race dynamics,favor speed over safety.,But I think,what's important to consider is,,at some point,,the cost of moving fast becomes too high.,We can't just develop things,in isolation,and put them out there without any thought,of where they could go in the future.,We've got to prevent,that atom bomb moment.,The stakes in the AI race,are massive.,I don't think a lot of people,appreciate the global stability,that has been provided,by having a superior military force,for the past 75 years.,And so the United States,and our allied forces,,they need to outperform adversarial AI.,There is no second place in war.,China laid out,an ambitious plan,to be the world leader in AI by 2030.,It's a race that some say America,is losing...,He will accelerate,the adoption of artificial intelligence,to ensure,our competitive military advantage.,We are racing forward,with this technology.,I think what's unclear,is how far are we going to go?,Do we control technology,,or does it control us?,There's really no opportunity,for do-overs.,Once the genie is out of the bottle,,it is out.,And it is very, very difficult,to put it back in.,And if we don't act now,,it's too late.,It may already be too late.,api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please,implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com"
